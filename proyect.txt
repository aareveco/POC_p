Project Description:
I need to develop a cross-platform application with an overlay interface (similar to Steam's overlay) that provides the following functionalities:

1. App Management & Control:
The application should allow users to add or remove a finite list of pre-defined applications to/from the overlay.
Once an app is added to the overlay, I want the ability to send commands or control the app directly from the overlay (if possible). 
This includes control over apps such as:
- **TeamViewer**: Launch a session with a specific connection ID.
- **OBS Studio**: Start streaming to another computer, handling authentication between the two systems without using third-party servers.
- **Image Software Editor**: Integrate or create an image software editor that allows basic image editing functionalities.
- **USB Signal Streaming**: Stream USB signals (e.g., peripherals, device signals) from one computer to another over the network.

2. Cross-Platform Compatibility:
The application needs to be cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux). This will be achieved using the **Electron** framework for a modern UI or **Qt** for better performance and native experience.

3. Overlay Interface (App Management & Control):
- The application will display an overlay with the ability to manage multiple video streams (cameras) and applications (TeamViewer, OBS, etc.)
- The overlay should support adding/removing apps and enabling direct control (via system commands or APIs) over them.
- **For TeamViewer**: Control sessions via CLI (e.g., `teamviewer.exe -i <session-id>`).
- **For OBS Studio**: Use the **OBS WebSocket API** to start streaming and manage settings.
- **For Image Software Editor**: Integrate libraries such as **PixiJS**, **Fabric.js**, or use Qt's native **QImage** class.

4. USB Signal Streaming:
- **Electron**: Use **node-usb** or **node-hid** for interacting with USB devices.
- **Qt**: Use **libusb** for USB interaction.
- For streaming over the network, use **WebRTC** or **WebSockets**.

5. Real-Time Interaction:
For all app control and streaming features, low-latency communication is essential. This will be addressed through efficient network protocols:
- **WebRTC** for real-time streaming (if applicable).
- **WebSockets** for fast, bidirectional communication between the overlay app and controlled apps.

6. Video Management:
- If the project includes video stream management, use **WebRTC** or similar technologies to ensure smooth video feed handling.
- Integrate video management capabilities for cameras (e.g., 3D, Zone1, Zone2, and other inputs).
- Support for 2D image capture and processing alongside video streams.

7. User Authentication & Management:
- Implement user roles (admin, user) for managing access and privileges over the overlay and app control functionalities.
- **Mobile/Web**: Use secure authentication methods (OAuth, JWT) for app access, especially for managing settings or controlling external apps.

8. Development Roadmap:
1. **Research & Planning**:
   - Define the exact functionalities for app control (e.g., parameters for TeamViewer, OBS).
   - Determine the USB signal protocol and streaming requirements.
   - Decide whether to build the image editor from scratch or integrate existing solutions.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - Choose between **Electron** and **Qt** based on your team's expertise and the need for performance.
   - Set up the project structure and dependencies (e.g., WebSocket libraries, USB libraries).

3. **Develop Overlay Interface**:
   - Implement the overlay UI with transparent windows and custom controls for adding/removing apps.
   - Ensure the overlay stays on top of other applications.

4. **Integrate App Control**:
   - Implement app control features for TeamViewer, OBS Studio, and the image editor.
   - Test external app control functionality using system commands and APIs.

5. **USB Signal Streaming**:
   - Implement USB interaction and ensure reliable data capture and streaming between computers.
   - Set up a network protocol for transmitting USB signals over the network.

6. **Real-Time Interaction**:
   - Implement **WebRTC** or **WebSockets** to ensure low-latency real-time communication for streaming and app control.

7. **Testing & Deployment**:
   - Test the application on all three platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   - Conduct performance testing, especially for USB streaming and overlay functionality.

9. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **Development Time**: Estimated at 6-8 months with a dedicated development team.
     - 3 senior developers, 10 hours per week each.
     - **Value per hour**: 1.5 UF (Chilean unit of account).
     - **Total monthly cost**: 180 UF, **Total (IVA included)**: 214.2 UF.
     - **Total Development Cost**: 1285.2 UF - 1713.6 UF.
   - **Infrastructure Costs**:
     - Estimated monthly infrastructure cost for 30 concurrent users and 300 registered users.
     - **Cost (on-demand)**: 450 USD/month, **Cost (saving plan)**: 320 USD/month.
     - Additional costs for licenses (e.g., TeamViewer, OBS Studio).

10. **Ongoing Maintenance & Updates**:
   - Continuous support and maintenance post-launch, ensuring server reliability, updates, and addressing security vulnerabilities.
